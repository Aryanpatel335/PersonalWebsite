        Hey there! I'm <strong>Aryan Patel</strong>, a budding Software Engineer
        with a knack for solving problems through code. Currently on my journey
        at <strong>McMaster University</strong>, I'm weaving through the
        intricacies of software development, with a keen eye on fintech
        innovations.
      </p>
      <p>
        With hands-on experience in{" "}
        <strong>Java, JavaScript, Python, and React</strong>, I'm crafting
        solutions from front to back, exploring the vast realms of web and
        backend development, and more. When not coding, you'll catch me at the
        gym or strategizing my next move in the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Driven by curiosity and the thrill of creation, I'm on a quest to make
        an impact, one line of code at a time.
      </p>
